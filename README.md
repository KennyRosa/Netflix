NETFLIX

- This is a project based on the popular movie site called Netflix. It is imitating their landing page and how movies get displayed. Upon a member logging in, he/she will see a list of movies by their image and title. 
- Additionally, I created a modal view upon clicking on each movie individually for a full description, the actors involved in the movie and rating.
- Built in API's were utilized for the project. Certain pieces of code carried API keys. As a result, Code is proprietary and I can only include code snippets.
